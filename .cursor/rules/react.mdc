# React Best Practices 

## Component Rules

### Component Architecture
- Use the new features of React v19 and Tailwind CSS v4.
- Keep component and hook clean, simple and focused
- Use composition over inheritance
- Split large component into smaller, focused ones
- Mobile first with responsive design

### Component Best Practices
- Use composition over inheritance or complex prop drilling
- Create reusable sub-components for complex UI patterns
- Use render props or compound components for flexible APIs
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Implement proper error boundaries where needed
- Support controlled and uncontrolled component
- Use useEffectEvent to extract non-reactive logic out of effects

### shadcn/ui Specific
- Extend existing shadcn components rather than rebuilding from scratch
- Prefer Base UI rather than Radix UI as the foundation when building new components
- Follow the shadcn/ui component API patterns and conventions
- Implement proper variant systems with sensible defaults
- Support theming through CSS custom properties
- Create components that integrate seamlessly with existing shadcn components

## Styling Guidelines
- Always use Tailwind classes with shadcn design tokens
- Use CSS variables for theme-aware styling (var(--primary))
- Implement proper focus states and accessibility indicators
- Follow shadcn/ui spacing and typography scales
- Use conditional classes with cn() utility function
- Use CVA for variant management and conditional styling
- Support dark mode through CSS variables

## Animation Guidelines

### Animation guidelines
- Use CSS Animation by tailwind and tw-animate-css for simple and reusable animations
- Use motion(not framer-motion) for the animations that are not possible with tailwind and tw-animate-css
- Follow 12 principles of animation (timing, spacing, anticipation, etc.)

### Motion Integration
- Use gesture recognition (drag, hover, tap, focus, inView) with proper event handling
- Implement spring physics and easing for natural motion feel
- Use variants for reusing and combining animation targets, and orchestrating animations throughout trees
- Use hooks such as useAnimate for more control over the animation
- Create consistent animation vocabulary across the application

## Accessibility Standards
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement ARIA labels, roles, and properties correctly
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- Provide proper focus management and visual indicators
- Include screen reader support with appropriate announcements
- Test with assistive technologies in mind
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
